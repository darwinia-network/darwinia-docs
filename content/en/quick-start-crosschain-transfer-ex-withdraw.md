If you purchase rings from a centralized exchange, you need to withdraw them from your exchange account to your MetaMask Ethereum wallet before transferring them to your Darwinia account.

There are a variety of exchanges that support rings transaction. Steps may vary from exchange to exchange. You should resort to their documentation to find out how to withdraw. But ensure to select the ERC20 chain; otherwise, you may suffer the loss of your assets.

Following is a screenshot of withdrawal on Huobi.
