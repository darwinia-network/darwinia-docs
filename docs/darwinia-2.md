# Darwinia 2.0 Is Coming ðŸ§¬ 

For Darwinia 1.0 (includes Darwinia Chain, Darwinia Parachain, and Darwinia Smartchain), we are currently working on a merging. Darwinia 1.0 will be discontinued following the merge, and Darwinia 2.0 will be launched by a referendum vote of Darwinia 1.0's on-chain community.

There will be just one mainnet chain left after the merge, which is the DARWINIA 2.

* Mainnet: Darwinia 2.0 
* Canary network: Crab 2.0
* Testnet: Pangolin 2.0, Pangoro 2.0

## About Darwinia 2.0

Darwinia 2.0 will be evm-compatiable.  
* Darwinia 2.0 will have the same address format to Ethereum and will also use the ECDSA cryptographic algorithm, which is also used by Ethereum. This means that the addresses in Darwinia 2.0 will be fully compatible with Ethereum addresses.
* The native token RING will have the same precision as ETH on Ethereum. 
* Developers can use the already familiar Ethereum infrastructure to develop applications on Darwinia 2.0.

Darwinia 2.0 will provide a stronger foundation for the future development of Darwinia, leading to higher code quality, faster development iteration cycles, shorter cross-chain routing paths, and a better user experience.
