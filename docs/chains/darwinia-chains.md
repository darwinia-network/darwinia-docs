# Darwinia Chains

Darwinia offers a number of different chains for development of messaging infrastructure and Dapp deployment, each with its own features and benefits.

## Darwinia Chain

Darwinia Chain (DC) is designed to be the primary chain for tokens and governance, main communication hub and routing point of LCMP, and will support most on-chain light clients for other public chains.

DC is a public chain that can operate independently with its own consensus and security model, with its core business and application services, including cross-chain functionality of each application chain, controlled by 
DC itself.

#### Pangoro

Pangoro is the test network of DC. The test tokens have no intrinsic value. You can get test tokens for Pangoro from [Pangoro faucet](./pangoro-faucet.md).

## Darwinia Parachain
Darwinia Parachain (DP) is designed to be protected by the shared security of the Polkadot Relay Chain. It will integrate Polkadotâ€™s XCMP, open channels with other parachains, and connect to DC via LCMP.

DP does not have its own economy.
#### Pangoro Parachain

Pangoro Parachain is the test network of DP.

## Darwinia Smart Chain

Darwinia Smart Chain (DSC) is an EVM-compatible smart contract platform hosted on DC, and is designed to provide greater programmability for Dapps and cross-chain users.

DSC does not have its own economy.

#### Pangolin Smart Chain

Pangolin Smart Chain is the EVM-compatible smart contract platform hosted on Pangoro.
